\\DIALOGUE
Blue Lady: I'm glad you've answered our call.  It seems like the vessel you were going to use crashed around here somewhere.
Blue Lady: Your consciousness seemed to have separated from your vessel.  That isn't a good sign, but not to worry.  I will lead you to your body.
Blue Lady: Hmm...  You should guide me.  It'll be a good chance to test your abilities and make them grow.  I'll explain the rules along the way.

Blue Lady: Those that join your party will have special abilities, myself included.  I have the ability to walk on water.  Try it.

Blue Lady: You're going to go into this area instead?  Aren't you a curious one?
Blue Lady: ..Very well.  I do ask that you do not guide me improperly, however.

Red Lady: HEY, WHY'D YOU LEAVE ME BEHIND?!
Blue Lady: You're rather loud.
Red Lady: ANSWER THE QUESTION!
Blue Lady: I just did.  Why are you here?
Red Lady: I WANNA GUIDE THE INTERN TOO!  Is the intern here?
Blue Lady: Stop talking in caps.  Yes, the intern is here.
Red Lady: 'Sup!  Nice to meet you, intern.
=Nice to meet you too, Miss.
  Red Lady: Look at that, the intern is so polite!  Unlike a certain blue monster.
  Blue Lady: Or a red one.
  Red Lady: HEY!
  Blue Lady: In any case, we've got a nice package at the very least.
  Red Lady: I agree!  Next time, don't leave me out of this, blue monster.
=Loudmouth.
  Red Lady: HEY!  I'M NOT A LOUDMOUTH!  YOU WANNA PIECE OF THIS?!
  Blue Lady: Such aggressiveness, loudmouth.
  Red Lady: YOU TOO?!  ARGH, I'LL REMEMBER THIS!
  Blue Lady: Having second thoughts about guiding the intern?
  Red Lady: NO!  BUT I WON'T GO EASY ON YOU LATER!
  Blue Lady: (You'll have to forgive her temper.  I suppose being on fire can make anyone cranky and loud..)
=Hey, sexy.
  Red Lady: ...
  Blue Lady: ...
  Blue Lady: ...Just a moment.  Huddle.
  Red Lady: Did you just hear what the intern said?
  Blue Lady: ...Yes.  This could be a problem.  It's only been a few minutes and the intern has already begun flirting, without a body no less.
  Red Lady: I'm ALREADY dealing with a pervert.  Is it too late to return to sender?
  Blue Lady: I'm afraid so.  If someone has something like that's child, it's going to be hard to explain...
  Red Lady: Let's.. have a truce for now and keep an eye on the intern.
  Blue Lady: Come on, intern.

Airy Lady: Yoohoo!  You forgot me, meanie!
Blue Lady: You as well?  I didn't need the entire party coming to pick up one person.
Airy Lady: Intern!  Where is he?  Oh, I hope he's cute; I mean, yeah, no relationships with mortals, but still, nothing wrong with a little bit of eye candy, right, right?
Blue Lady: The intern doesn't even have a body yet.  We don't even know if the intern is male or female.
Airy Lady: But I'm so curious!  Hey, hey, intern, are you a boy?  A cute boy?  A really, really cute boy?
=Yes
  Airy Lady: Yay!  A really, really cute boy!  I can't wait to see what you look like!
  Blue Lady: Remember that eye candy is not what we called him for.
  Airy Lady: I know, Ms. Blue Meanie.  It's still nice, though.
  if (HEY SEXY) {
    Red Lady: You can have him; I don't want another pervert on my hands.
    Airy Lady: Oh, he's a perv?  I don't like pervs.

  Red Lady: 
=No
  Airy Lady: Aww, no fair, my dreams, my poor dreams.
  if (HEY SEXY) {
    Red Lady: ...WAIT.  Then, does that mean the intern swings the other way?!
    Blue Lady: Perhaps it's a misunderstanding.  Like "Hey Sexy" is merely a greeting or a joke where she comes from?
    Earthy Lady: Is it, Ms. Intern?
    =Yes
      Red Lady: Whew.  Well then, hey sexy right back at you!
      Blue Lady: I don't see how you can say that so quickly after fretting so much.
      HEYSEXYFLAGOFF
    =No
      Red Lady: EH?!
      Blue Lady: I don't see why it's that surprising.
      Redy Lady: YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO SHE SAID "HEY SEXY" TO!
      =Hey Sexy Blue Lady.
        Blue Lady: Are you happy now?  She said it to me too.  Even in other worlds, women can swing either or both ways.
      =Hey Sexier Blue Lady.
        Blue Lady: ......What?
        Airy Lady: It looks like she liiiiiiiiikes you more!
        Red Lady: HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!
        
      =You're the only one for me!
        Airy Lady: Oooooooooh, it's a confession!  A confession!
        Blue Lady: Aren't you happy?  Why don't you two have a nice dinner together at a volcano?
        Red Lady: SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!
